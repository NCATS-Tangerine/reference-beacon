# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 

## Overview 
 
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Set your Neo4j database access credentials in the ogm.properties file. If desired, change the default web site server.port value in application.properties. 

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

(or the port you set)
